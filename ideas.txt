Going into this idea remember the following:

Have fun with this.
Pivot and iterate.
Find a solution to your own problems.

Meeting people is tedious because there is no filtering mechanism in place. (Tinder works well because it filters by physical attractiveness)
But there are many other trait displays that have not been catered to.

The idea is to have some sort of trait display or filter (something that gives a score) that acts as a filtering and pairing mechanism to get to the 2nd stage which is a “call to action” i.e. to meet up, whether that be in an event based scenario or one on one.

Starting off, let’s try to pull on human experiences and memories. Filtering to create trends or big events where people can meet and converse. 

Events could refresh every day or every so often. One post per day.

Bringing spontaneity into local areas. Recording audio journaling people can share?


//RANDOM IDEAS
socially constructive anonymity?
 -> Giving the comfort of not having to think about xxx. (medium scale, thinking large scale you’ll create something). Distracted by FB/Texting when you go to it. 10 words a day. Group dynamics. Visualizing yourself to send data to others.
